We often take SQLite for granted. It’s the "little database that could," living inside our phones, browsers, and even the flight software of the Airbus A350. We treat it like a simple library that reads a file, but under the hood, SQLite is a masterclass in modular software architecture. It’s a complete database engine that implements a custom virtual machine, a sophisticated page cache, and a B-Tree storage system, all within a single C library.

The architecture is often described as a "sandwich" of layers, each with a very specific, isolated responsibility.

### The Virtual Database Engine (VDBE)

Most people think of SQL as a language that the database "just understands." In SQLite, SQL is actually compiled into bytecode. When you send a query, the frontend (tokenizer and parser) converts it into a program for the **VDBE**. 

The VDBE is effectively a CPU for SQL. It has its own instruction set (like `OpenRead`, `SeekGe`, and `Column`), its own registers, and its own program counter. This design is what makes SQLite so portable and easy to debug—you can literally see the "assembly code" of your SQL query by prefixing it with `EXPLAIN`.

### The B-Tree Layer: Organising the Bits

Once the VDBE decides it needs to find a record, it talks to the **B-Tree Layer**. This is where the database starts thinking about data structures instead of SQL rows. 

SQLite uses two types of trees:
1.  **Table B+Trees:** Used to store the actual data. The key is always the 64-bit `ROWID`, and the actual column data is stored only in the leaf nodes. This makes full-table scans very efficient.
2.  **Index B-Trees:** Used for your indexes. These are standard B-Trees where both the key and the pointer to the `ROWID` can exist in the interior nodes.

The B-Tree layer doesn't know anything about files or disks. It thinks in terms of **Pages**. It asks for "Page 42," and it expects a fixed-size block of bytes in return.

```text
ASCII B+Tree Hierarchy:
       [ Root Page ]
      /      |      \
 [Page 2] [Page 3] [Page 4]  <-- Interior Nodes (Keys only)
    |        |        |
 [L1][L2] [L3][L4] [L5][L6]  <-- Leaf Nodes (Keys + Data)
```

### The Pager: Caching and Concurrency

The **Pager Layer** is the brain of the storage engine. Its job is to provide the B-Tree layer with the pages it needs while minimizing slow disk I/O. It manages the **Page Cache**, an in-memory copy of the most recently used pages from the file.

The Pager also handles the most difficult part of database engineering: **Concurrency**. It uses a locking mechanism (Shared, Reserved, Pending, Exclusive) to ensure that two people don't try to write to the same page at the same time. But the real magic is how it handles crashes.

### ACID Internals: Rollback vs. WAL

SQLite ensures your data is safe even if the power goes out, using two different methods:

**1. Rollback Journal (The Traditional Way):**
Before the Pager modifies a page in the database file, it copies the *original* version of that page into a separate `-journal` file. If the system crashes mid-write, the next person to open the database will see the journal, realize a write failed, and "play back" the original pages to restore the DB to a consistent state.

**2. Write-Ahead Log (WAL):**
In WAL mode, the main database file is never touched during a write. Instead, all changes are appended to a separate `-wal` file. This is a game changer for performance because **readers do not block writers**. You can have a hundred people reading the "old" version of the DB from the main file while one person is appending the "new" version to the WAL. Periodically, a "checkpoint" process moves the changes from the WAL back into the main file.

### The VFS: The Portability Layer

Finally, we reach the **VFS (Virtual File System)**. This is the only part of SQLite that actually makes OS-level system calls like `open()`, `read()`, and `fsync()`. 

By swapping out the VFS, you can run SQLite on anything. You can write a VFS that stores the database in RAM, one that encrypts data on the fly, or even one that stores the database in a cloud bucket. This isolation is why SQLite is the most widely deployed database in history.

### The Lesson of SQLite

SQLite proves that you don't need a massive server process to have a reliable, high-performance database. By layering abstractions—bytecode machine, B-Tree logic, page management, and OS isolation—it creates a system that is greater than the sum of its parts. It treats your data not just as a file, but as a carefully organized and protected memory space that just happens to live on a disk. It’s a reminder that good architecture isn't about how much your system can do, but about how cleanly it divides the work of doing it.
